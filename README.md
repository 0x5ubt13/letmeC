# letmeC
Using some C to try and nail some basic concepts.

Snippets available:

1. [Hello world!](./HelloWorld/HelloWorld.c)
    - Why of course.
2. [Basic calculator](./Basic%20Calculator/basic_calculator.c)
    - A basic calculator to get started in C that takes 3 arguments: two numbers and either words or symbols
3. [C-heatsheet](./C-heatsheet/c-heatsheet.c)
    - A cheatsheet inspired in the one I did for [Go](https://github.com/0x5ubt13/LetsGo/blob/main/Massive_Cheatsheet/massiveCheatSheet.go), but in C this time. Functions explained and available to consult:
        - Types and their sizes in memory
        - Recursion
        - Pointers
        - Arrays lv.1 and lv.2
        - Linked lists lv.1 and lv.2
